# Delloitte_Virtual_Internship

Collection of completed tasks required for the Deloitte Australia Virtual Experience Program on Forager.
Completed December 2023, the program involved five short tasks to build familiarity with technology used in the Deloitte workplace. Namely, the tasks required the use of Python, Excel and Tableau to solve rudimentary problems, as well as a basic understanding of cyber security and project management to deliver a proposal for the theoretical implementation of telometry software.
The support files are owned by the Deloitte group and are used solely to provide context to the nature of taskn completed.
